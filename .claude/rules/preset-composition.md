## Preset Composition

**Composition order**: Presets compose explicitly over a project that has already been bootstrapped and cleaned. Base comes first, optional overlays come after, and template rendering happens after preset copies.

**Ownership rule**: Each emitted file should have a clear owner:

- copied from a preset source
- rendered from a template
- finalized by an explicit generation step

**Avoid hidden coupling**: If multiple presets influence the same emitted file, make ownership explicit. Prefer a single template or a clearly defined overlay rule over accidental last-write-wins behavior.

**No native reliance**: Presets must not depend on incidental files left behind by Bun or TanStack scaffolds. If native scaffold output matters, cleanup and ownership should make that explicit first.

**No magic mutation**: Do not introduce cross-preset behavior that depends on implicit side effects, undocumented ordering assumptions, or ad hoc patching.
